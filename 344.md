# Exhibition: Sketches / Studies / Statements
## November 3, 2018 - June 9, 2019

Ideas run wild and what do artists do? They attempt to capture them and sometimes harness them—by drawing. Cheap, portable materials—paper, pencils, ink, chalk—can turn any flat surface into a drawing studio. Lightning-quick drawings can sear a thought onto the page. Focused drawings help artists work out challenging passages within a larger composition. 

For the most part, artists did not intend to share such drawings with curious observers. But with the passage of time and the dispersal of their studio materials after death, we sometimes get to peer over their shoulders. The drawings you see here, all new to Mia’s galleries, range from the 1500s to the present day, and from the blazing gesture to the carefully considered line. Together they confirm the enduring role of drawing as a means to capture, develop, and present ideas.
