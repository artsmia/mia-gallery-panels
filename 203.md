# Beyond the Fragrance: Beauty and Symbolism in Chinese Flower and Bird Painting

Flowers and birds are ubiquitous motifs in Chinese art. But China’s enduring fascination with these subjects is more than an aesthetic regard for natural beauty. These motifs are often suffused with poetic overtones or imbued with social and political allusions—a rich and ancient symbolism. 


The symbolism of flowers and birds stems from their natural qualities—their shapes, habits, seasonality, or medicinal properties—or their appearance in myth, legend, and literature. Sometimes they are linked to particular deities or famous people. 


These associations developed in the imperial court, influenced by Daoist and Buddhist beliefs. The highly educated class of government bureaucrats, or “literati,” elaborated the symbolism around these subjects and made them a focus of literature and the visual arts. Other social classes, in turn, enshrined them in popular culture.
