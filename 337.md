# Life at the Edge of Empire: North America, c. 1760–1812

The Charleston Dining and Drawing Rooms come from the 1772 Charleston, South Carolina, home of John Stuart, Britain’s superintendent of Indian Affairs, the chief diplomat to the Southeast’s Native peoples. At Mia, these rooms have traditionally been installed with period-appropriate furniture and paintings to illustrate the tastes of people who resembled John Stuart in their wealth and social station. 

But in many cases these artworks reveal far more about John Stuart’s world than its fashion sense. For North Americans in the late 1700s and early 1800s—whether free or enslaved, Native American or of African or European descent—life was impacted by a common set of historical forces, albeit in very different ways. These forces—territorial conflicts, international diplomacy, global trade of precious materials, and shifting national identities—are in some ways embodied by the worldly possessions you see before you. The objects expose deeper themes that tell a more complete story of North America and its inhabitants.
