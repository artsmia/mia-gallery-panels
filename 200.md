# Buddhist Art

2,500 years ago a prince became acutely aware of human suffering and began seeking a way to escape it. Abandoning a life of luxury, he spent six years depriving himself of food and sleep before turning away from such extreme practices to propose a more moderate Middle Path. After a period of deep meditation he attained enlightenment, an awareness of the true nature of things and the knowledge that suffering is escapable. Now called Buddha, the Awakened One, he spent the rest of his life traveling throughout northern India, teaching others how they, too, could escape suffering. From the Buddhaâ€™s teachings emerged Buddhism, which over the centuries spread throughout Asia. As it did, it picked up aspects of local beliefs, its teachings expanded and evolved, and its many schools and sects came to encompass a vast array of deities and approaches to liberation. The works of Buddhist art on display in this gallery, created in cultures throughout Asia and across time, are a testament to that diverse tradition.
