# Uncanny Blossoming

Since its inception, photography has expanded our understanding of the world’s flora. Images of plant life have helped generations of scientists, artists, and activists define the parameters of the natural world, celebrate its beauty, and advance policies for its protection. Yet photographs can do more than document the physical particulars of plants: they can unsettle our relationship with them, provoking us to see them anew.

This exhibition explores a blossoming world with an eye for the uncanny and the unsettling—photographs of plants and flowers that remind us of the uneasy terms of our coexistence.  Reeds appear to claw at the walls of a house. Weeds spring up through an abandoned bed frame, as if to replace the human body that once slept there. A man struts down the sidewalk, unaware of his striking resemblance to the untrimmed tree in the background. Blurring the distinctions between plant and human, animate and still life, these photographs point to a new way of perceiving life on earth.
