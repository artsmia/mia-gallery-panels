# Exhibition: Without Boundaries
## Fiber Sculptures and Paintings by Women Artists
## July 28, 2018 - July 21, 2019

This installation explores the relationship between painting and fiber art, genres that have been treated differently in museums. Often fiber art has been denigrated as “women’s work” and considered less intellectually complex than painting. The artists (and Mia’s curators) in this installation have rejected this assumption and embraced all materials as worthwhile. 

Feminist artists in the 1970s reclaimed the phrase “women’s work” as a political assertion of the importance of making art that had its roots in socially gendered activities. Artists working with fiber insisted that it stood on its own as a vehicle for meaningful ideas, innovative form, and transformative visual experiences. The painters brought together here often took inspiration from and influenced fashion and textiles. “Without Boundaries” presents these materials in dialogue in order to reveal the surprising common ground the artists share.
