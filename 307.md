# Aristocratic Diversions

The Italian cities of Rome, Naples, and Venice were popular destinations in the 18th century for a certain sort of tourist: the aristocratic sort. As centers of ancient Roman history and Renaissance art, these cities formed part of the Grand Tour undertaken by the elite to improve their education and taste. Rome was a seat of religious power and architectural wonder. Venice was the gem of the Adriatic, captured by artists in accurate topographical records as well as imaginative concoctions inspired by the city’s famous sights.

Several of the artworks in this gallery also reflect the elegance and delicacy that captivated followers of French taste at the beginning of the 18th century. Sitting for portraits, the most effective demonstration of status and adherence to fashion, aristocrats would often surround themselves with symbols of their stature or their prowess at music and letters.
