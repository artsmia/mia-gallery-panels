## The Queen Anne Room

England, the saying goes, was built on oak. It is an emblem of strength, deeply rooted in the nation’s lore, and this room is literally covered in it. But around 1720, when the room was built, English oaks were in short supply. A hurricane in 1703 had toppled thousands of the trees across Britain. Much had to be imported from Europe and eventually North America, turning the familiar hardwood into a luxury.
Oak’s tight grain and hardness make it one of the most challenging and rewarding woods to carve, yielding reluctantly to the chisel but polishing to a warm sheen. This room, with its intricately sculpted fruits and flowers above the fireplace, is a celebration of oak—and the master carvers who could unlock its stubborn beauty.
